The color kit is a Google Chrome Extension for both choosing colors 
and performing conversions between RGB, HSV, and Hex directly in the browser.
A variety of tools are available within the extension:

* Choosing colors from RGB and HSV sliders
* 2D gradients against a third value (e.g. Sat/Val over Hue) similar to Photoshop and other apps
* Named list of color palettes such as Web Safe and Pantone colors
* Choosing colors from uploaded images
* Eyedropper tool for grabing colors from webpages (coming soon)
* User ability to upload files to provide their own color palettes
* Output as hex color (and other CSS color types coming soon)
